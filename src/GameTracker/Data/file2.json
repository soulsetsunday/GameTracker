Metroid Prime combines multiple gameplay elements, such as platforming, <a href=\"\/puzzles\/3015-932\/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-932\">puzzles<\/a>, <a href=\"\/exploration\/3015-767\/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-767\">exploration<\/a> and shooting, while presenting a large, <a href=\"\/open-world\/3015-207\/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-207\">open-ended world<\/a>.<\/p><p>Metroid Prime revolves around <a href=\"\/phazon\/3015-49\/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-49\">Phazon<\/a>, a highly radioactive substance with mutagenic properties. The game takes place on <a href=\"\/tallon-iv\/3035-168\/\" data-ref-id=\"3035-168\">Tallon IV<\/a>, which has been corrupted by this substance. Throughout her journey, <a href=\"\/samus-aran\/3005-99\/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-99\">Samus<\/a> learns more about the nature of Phazon, as well as how her enemies, the <a href=\"\/space-pirate\/3015-1137\/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-1137\">Space Pirates<\/a>, intend to use it. She also learns of the <a href=\"\/chozo\/3015-605\/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-605\">Chozo<\/a>'s struggles, an ancient race that lived on Tallon IV when the infection first arrived.<\/p><p>As well as maintaining most of the traditional Metroid gameplay features, Metroid Prime introduces a number of innovations to the series. The first person perspective led to the introduction of <a href=\"\/auto-aim\/3015-145\/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-145\">lock-on targeting<\/a>, which allowed for a more intuitive combat system, as well as the ability to strafe around enemies. A <a href=\"\/heads-up-display\/3015-180\/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-180\">heads-up display<\/a> was introduced, which showed Samus' health bar and ammunition, among other details. A multiple visor system was incorporated, which allowed for different kinds of displays. The most intriguing display was the scan visor, which allowed a multitude of objects and creatures to be surveyed in great detail, as well as activating lifts and revealing <a href=\"\/weak-spot\/3015-296\/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-296\">weak points<\/a>. A hint system was built into the game to aid players.<\/p><p>Metroid Prime saw great success worldwide, particularly in America. This commercial success led to the development of a Metroid Prime trilogy, as well as other Metroid Prime spinoffs.<\/p><h2>Gameplay<\/h2><p>When Metroid Prime was revealed, the most controversial aspect of the game was its first-person perspective. With the game's release, however, reception eventually turned positive, with many generally accepting that the gameplay did not suffer at all from the new perspective.<\/p><p>Metroid Prime, like its predecessors, places a large emphasis on exploration. <a href=\"\/tallon-iv\/3035-168\/\" data-ref-id=\"3035-168\">Tallon IV<\/a> is an open world, ready for Samus to discover all its secrets, fitting with Metroid tradition. There are only a few instances in the game where the player is given a linear direction, albeit through subtle hints.<\/p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/5911\/492600-mp_queen_2.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-492600\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.75\" data-width=\"480\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 480px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:75.0%\" href=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/5911\/492600-mp_queen_2.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-492600\"><img alt=\"The Parasite Queen blasts Samus with a beam of energy.\" src=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/0\/5911\/492600-mp_queen_2.jpg\" srcset=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/5911\/492600-mp_queen_2.jpg 480w, https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/0\/5911\/492600-mp_queen_2.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"><\/a><figcaption>The Parasite Queen blasts Samus with a beam of energy.<\/figcaption><\/figure><p>The player controls Samus using the analog control stick. Unlike other first-person games of the era, Metroid Prime is controlled primarily with a single analog stick, rather then the dual stick format. In order to look around, players must use the R button. The R button allows the players to use the analog stick to look around and observe the environment, as well as aim at opponents. Samus also has the ability to jump using the B button. Platforming is an important element of Metroid Prime, as in previous entries in the series. Metroid Prime has been praised for its excellence in platforming, something few thought executed well in the first-person perspective.<\/p><p>Combat in Metroid Prime is similar to that of most other first-person shooter games, utilizing a variety of weapons. Samus fires using the A button, and when in the <a href=\"\/morph-ball\/3055-1049\/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-1049\">morph ball<\/a>, Samus uses the A button to drop bombs. To lock on to enemies, Samus uses the L button. By lightly pressing the L button while locked on, Samus can swap out targets. If the player does not wish to lock on, they can look freely using the R button, and aim at opponents through that method. While locked on, the player can press the B button to dash from side to side. Samus must use all of her beam weapons, as well as her missiles, activated with the Y button.<\/p><p>The C-stick is used to select the weapon which Samus will use. Samus's basic weapon is the power beam, which she begins with. Throughout the course of the game, Samus can obtain the <a href=\"\/plasma-beam\/3055-1024\/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-1024\">plasma beam<\/a>, the <a href=\"\/wave-beam\/3055-1023\/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-1023\">wave beam<\/a>, and the <a href=\"\/ice-beam\/3055-906\/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-906\">ice beam<\/a>. The plasma beam shoots short tang molten energy and can potentially ignite enemies, as well as melt ice. The wave beam fires three oscillating waves of electric energy, and has a limited homing effect. The ice beam is a cold blast of frozen water, and has a slow rate of fire. It can also potentially freeze an enemy in their tracks for a brief amount of time. Each weapon is strong against particular enemies, and all can be combo fires with Samus' missiles for greater effect. Once Samus obtains the charge beam, all weapons can be charged up as well, providing greater firepower.<\/p><p>In order to access many areas, Samus must use her weapons to destroy obstacles. Many doors are blocked by shields which require certain weapons to activate, and others have blast shields that must be destroyed with the missiles.<\/p><p>Samus has a variety of <a href=\"\/heads-up-display\/3015-180\/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-180\">visors<\/a> which will come in handy throughout the game, as well. The standard visor is the combat visor, which is used through regular gameplay. One of the most important visors, which Samus has at the beginning of the game, is the <a href=\"\/scan-visor\/3055-1040\/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-1040\">scan visor<\/a>. The scan visor is used to scan nearly everything in the environment. Scanning proves useful for gathering details about enemies, and discovering the most efficient way of taking them out. Scanning is also one of the main ways that Metroid Prime implements world-building, providing information on the lifeforms in proximity to Samus, as well as translating diary entries and other logs. Another useful visor is the <a href=\"\/thermal-visor\/3055-1042\/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-1042\">thermal visor<\/a>, which helps Samus track objects in the environment based on their heat signature. This visor is quite helpful in dark areas, enabling samus to see lifeforms clearly. Finally, the <a href=\"\/x-ray-visor\/3055-1041\/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-1041\">X-ray<\/a> vison allows Samus to look through walls to find secret passages, and track enemies who use <a href=\"\/stealth-camouflage\/3055-846\/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-846\">optical camouflage<\/a>.<\/p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/5911\/492601-mp_orpheon_parasite_specimen.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-492601\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.7\" data-width=\"480\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 480px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:70.0%\" href=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/5911\/492601-mp_orpheon_parasite_specimen.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-492601\"><img alt=\"A deceased Parasite specimen in Orpheon.\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/0\/5911\/492601-mp_orpheon_parasite_specimen.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/5911\/492601-mp_orpheon_parasite_specimen.jpg 480w, https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/0\/5911\/492601-mp_orpheon_parasite_specimen.jpg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"A deceased Parasite specimen in Orpheon.\" src=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/0\/5911\/492601-mp_orpheon_parasite_specimen.jpg\" srcset=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/5911\/492601-mp_orpheon_parasite_specimen.jpg 480w, https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/0\/5911\/492601-mp_orpheon_parasite_specimen.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"><\/noscript><\/a><figcaption>A deceased Parasite specimen in Orpheon.<\/figcaption><\/figure><p>Like all previous Metroid games, Samus can transform into the morph ball. The morph ball is activated using the X button. Combat is limited, however, in morph ball mode, and Samus can only use the bombs, dropped using the A or Y buttons. The bombs prove most useful for morph ball jumping. A morph ball jump is performed by laying a bomb, then lingering over the bomb, which will shoot Samus into the air. Multiple bombs can be laid to reach higher areas.<\/p><p>One of the most useful tools in the game is the map. The <a href=\"\/world-map\/3015-611\/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-611\">map<\/a> is accessed using the Z button, and is a detailed three dimensional depiction of Tallon IV. As exploration is so important in Metroid Prime, consulting the map becomes regular throughout the course of the game.<\/p><p>As in all Metroid games, items are scattered across the planet. Samus begins with a number of suit upgrades. After an accident on the Frigate, however, Samus begins on Tallon IV with merely her power beam and power suit. As she explores more and more, she can regain her arsenal. Most weapons and visors are hidden throughout the game, and in order to obtain them and move further on in the game, Samus must find out how to reach them. Not all items are essential to the player's progress; however, some will prove very useful. Energy tanks and missile tanks are not required, but are still of great assistance. Some of the more notable items Samus can find are the <a href=\"\/varia-suit\/3055-1032\/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-1032\">Varia Suit<\/a> and <a href=\"\/gravity-suit\/3055-1033\/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-1033\">Gravity Suit<\/a>, as well as the <a href=\"\/hi-jump-boots\/3055-1448\/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-1448\">space jump boots<\/a>, which allow Samus to <a href=\"\/double-jump\/3015-1\/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-1\">double jump<\/a>. Metroid Prime also marked the return of the <a href=\"\/grapple-beam\/3055-1053\/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-1053\">Grapple Beam<\/a> from <a href=\"\/super-metroid\/3030-8292\/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-8292\">Super Metroid<\/a>, which allowed Samus to grapple onto specific points and swing over great distances.<\/p><h3>Wii Release<\/h3><p>On October 2, 2008, Nintendo revealed plans to bring various Gamecube games over to the Wii with new controls, including Metroid Prime. The official name of the Wii release is called \"<a href=\"\/new-play-control\/3025-1197\/\" data-ref-id=\"3025-1197\">New Play Control<\/a>! Metroid Prime\". In this rerelease, players control Samus with the Wiimote and Nunchuck, matching the controls of <a href=\"\/metroid-prime-3-corruption\/3030-4725\/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-4725\">Metroid Prime 3<\/a>. Movement is controlled by the analog stick on the Nunchuck. The biggest change to the controls is the aiming, which is now controlled by the Wii's IR pointer. Lock-on is still available and is done via the Z button. Shooting is mapped to the A button (missiles and other weapons on the directional pad) while jumping is controlled by the B button. As in Metroid Prime 3, changing visors is done by pressing the minus button and choosing the visor wanted by pointing on screen. Despite these changes, the Wii rerelease is the same Metroid Prime that was played on the GameCube. The Wii release also has 16:9 Widescreen and 480p support.<\/p><h2>Regions<\/h2><h3>Frigate Orpheon<\/h3><p>A Space Pirate frigate, this vessel was used by the Space Pirate Science Team for <a href=\"\/experiments-gone-awry\/3015-2046\/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-2046\">experiments<\/a>, some more bizarre than others. This is where the <a href=\"\/parasite-queen\/3005-4286\/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-4286\">Parasite Queen<\/a> resides, as well as the place that gave birth to a reborn <a href=\"\/ridley\/3005-1305\/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-1305\">Ridley<\/a>. In the beginning of the game, it is still partly functional. Samus eventually returns to the ruins of the Frigate.<\/p><h3>Tallon Overworld<\/h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/9336\/208454-metroid_prime_4.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-208454\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.75\" data-width=\"400\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 400px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:75.0%\" href=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/9336\/208454-metroid_prime_4.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-208454\"><img alt=\"A cavern in the Tallon Overworld.\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/0\/9336\/208454-metroid_prime_4.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/9336\/208454-metroid_prime_4.jpg 400w, https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/0\/9336\/208454-metroid_prime_4.jpg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"A cavern in the Tallon Overworld.\" src=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/0\/9336\/208454-metroid_prime_4.jpg\" srcset=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/9336\/208454-metroid_prime_4.jpg 400w, https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/0\/9336\/208454-metroid_prime_4.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"><\/noscript><\/a><figcaption>A cavern in the Tallon Overworld.<\/figcaption><\/figure><p>The place where Samus first lands, the Overworld is a green place, always raining.

It protects Samus from the effects of blue phazon (though not orange phazon), and provides the most damage reduction of any suit.

This led Nintendo to clarify that the game is a \"First Person Adventure\" and not a first-person shooter. Once the game was released, however, many critics and former detractors praised the game's level design and incredible graphics. It was stated as being a great reinvention of the Metroid franchise into 3D. Many stated that the gameplay was well done and that the lock-on feature was a welcome addition as it allowed easy strafing.

Corruption makes substantial use of the motion sensing Remote. While the player still has the option to lock-on to any opponent on the screen and strafe around that foe, the control scheme allows you to freely fire at any on-screen enemy by simply pointing the remote at the screen, while using Wii Remote gestures for contraptions such as levers and the grapple hook. The standard gameplay elements of the Metroid series are still largely present in Corruption. The player once again takes the role of bounty hunter <a href=\"\/samus-aran\/3005-99\/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-99\">Samus Aran<\/a>, who visits multiple planets this time around. As expected, Samus explores different areas while earning new abilities that allow her to overcome previously impassable environmental obstacles.<\/p><h2>Gameplay<\/h2><p>Corruption is a traditional first-person shooter, similar to the previous two Metroid Prime games. Corruption is controlled using the Wii Remote's motion sensor. The player can aim and shoot using the Wii Remote and Nunchuk combination (the Nunchuk's analog stick controls movement while the Wii Remote controls viewpoint). The Wii Remote also controls other actions, such as jumping and firing.<\/p><p>Corruption takes place across a variety of planets in the world of Metroid Prime. Several of these planets have been overtaken by <a href=\"\/phazon\/3015-49\/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-49\">Phazon<\/a>, an incredibly dangerous substance that <a href=\"\/samus-aran\/3005-99\/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-99\">Samus<\/a> has been exposed to (thus granting her special Phazon based abilities). She can go into a hyper mode, in which her Phazon meter keeps her in that mode. She is much more powerful in this mode, and can destroy Phazon corrupted objects and enemies.<\/p><p>The game also contains a variety of puzzles relating to Samus' abilities. For example, she uses her <a href=\"\/morph-ball\/3055-1049\/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-1049\">Morph Ball<\/a> ability to go into smaller areas and use the bomb to trigger certain events. Samus' visor has many of her other abilities, in addition to having the heads-up display. Other visors can be unlocked, from an X-ray visor to a heat vision visor.<\/p><h2>Plot<\/h2><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/5911\/515654-gandrayda2.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-515654\" data-size=\"small\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-ratio=\"0.75\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:75.0%\" href=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/5911\/515654-gandrayda2.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-515654\"><img alt=\"Gandrayda has shape-shifting abilities.\" src=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/0\/5911\/515654-gandrayda2.jpg\" srcset=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/5911\/515654-gandrayda2.jpg 480w, https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/0\/5911\/515654-gandrayda2.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"><\/a><figcaption>Gandrayda has shape-shifting abilities.<\/figcaption><\/figure><p>Corruption stars Samus Aran, the main protagonist of the Metroid franchise.

When she wakes up on a Galactic Federation ship, it is revealed that she has been corrupted with Phazon, the incredibly mutagenic substance that Dark Samus specializes in. To combat this Phazon, Samus is given a Phazon Enhancement Device (PED) that allows her to use the Phazon produced by her body as a power source. The other bounty hunters had awakened much earlier, and were already sent off to investigate other planets. Samus is initially sent to two planets, <a href=\"\/planet-bryyo\/3035-651\/\" data-ref-id=\"3035-651\">Bryyo<\/a> and <a href=\"\/planet-elysia\/3035-650\/\" data-ref-id=\"3035-650\">Elysia<\/a>, to search for these missing bounty hunters. Here, she finds that to combat the Phazon corrupting the galaxy, she must destroy all of the Leviathan Seeds embedded in various planets.<\/p><p>The Space Pirates are intent on stopping Samus from attaining this goal, however, sending forth various creatures that have been exposed to this mutagen. Samus also encounters her fellow bounty hunters, who, unable to control their PEDs, were completely corrupted. As the game progresses, Samus gradually becomes further corrupted with Phazon. After investigating the Space Pirate Homeworld, Samus finds that all of the Phazon has been coming from Phaaze, a planet accessible only via a wormhole created by a modified Leviathan. There, she confronts Dark Samus and a corrupted Aurora Unit 313. She defeats them in combat, and as a result Phazon is eradicated from the galaxy. The game ends with Samus flying off into space, with a ship resembling Sylux's (a bounty hunter from Metroid Prime: Hunters) ship following her.<\/p><h2>Weapons<\/h2><h4>Power Beam<\/h4><p style=\"margin-left: 30px;\" data-right-indent=\"0\">Quickest to fire, and also quickest moving but has the lowest damage per shot, good to use on fast moving enemies.

It was criticized, however, for a lower difficulty, overall similarity to the previous two installments in the series, and minor gripes with the context-sensitive motion gesturing.<\/p><h2>Trilogy Re-Release<\/h2><p>On August 24th, 2009, Metroid Prime 3: Corruption was re-released on the Wii in North America as part of the <a href=\"\/metroid-prime-trilogy\/3030-26559\/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-26559\">Metroid Prime Trilogy <\/a>along with the first two games updated with motion controls.<\/p>","expected_release_day":null,"expected_release_month":null,"expected_release_quarter":null,"expected_release_year":null,"id":4725,"image":{"icon_url":"https:\/\/www.giantbomb.com\/api\/image\/square_avatar\/2392952-metroid_prime_3_corruption_02_artwork.jpg","medium_url":"https:\/\/www.giantbomb.com\/api\/image\/scale_medium\/2392952-metroid_prime_3_corruption_02_artwork.jpg","screen_url":"https:\/\/www.giantbomb.com\/api\/image\/screen_medium\/2392952-metroid_prime_3_corruption_02_artwork.jpg","small_url":"https:\/\/www.giantbomb.com\/api\/image\/scale_small\/2392952-metroid_prime_3_corruption_02_artwork.jpg","super_url":"https:\/\/www.giantbomb.com\/api\/image\/scale_large\/2392952-metroid_prime_3_corruption_02_artwork.jpg","thumb_url":"https:\/\/www.giantbomb.com\/api\/image\/scale_avatar\/2392952-metroid_prime_3_corruption_02_artwork.jpg","tiny_url":"https:\/\/www.giantbomb.com\/api\/image\/square_mini\/2392952-metroid_prime_3_corruption_02_artwork.jpg"},"name":"Metroid Prime 3: Corruption","number_of_user_reviews":23,"original_game_rating":[{"api_detail_url":"https:\/\/www.giantbomb.com\/api\/game_rating\/3065-1\/","id":1,"name":"ESRB: T"},{"api_detail_url":"https:\/\/www.giantbomb.com\/api\/game_rating\/3065-36\/","id":36,"name":"PEGI: 12+"},{"api_detail_url":"https:\/\/www.giantbomb.com\/api\/game_rating\/3065-31\/","id":31,"name":"OFLC: M"},{"api_detail_url":"https:\/\/www.giantbomb.com\/api\/game_rating\/3065-33\/","id":33,"name":"CERO: B"}],"original_release_date":"2007-08-28 00:00:00","platforms":[{"api_detail_url":"https:\/\/www.giantbomb.com\/api\/platform\/3045-36\/","id":36,"name":"Wii","site_detail_url":"https:\/\/www.giantbomb.com\/wii\/3045-36\/","abbreviation":"Wii"}],"site_detail_url":"https:\/\/www.giantbomb.com\/metroid-prime-3-corruption\/3030-4725\/","resource_type":"game"},{"aliases":"Metroid Prime: Blast Ball","api_detail_url":"https:\/\/www.giantbomb.com\/api\/game\/3030-49959\/","date_added":"2015-06-15 01:35:31","date_last_updated":"2016-12-14 01:09:20","deck":"A co-operative handheld spin-off of the Metroid Prime trilogy has up to four players, as the power-suited Marines of the Galactic Federation, assisting Samus Aran in investigating a possible resurgence of Space Pirates.","description":"<h2>Overview<\/h2><figure data-ref-id=\"1300-2760578\" data-img-src=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/8\/82063\/2760578-9927725383-TM_3D.jpg\" data-size=\"small\" data-align=\"right\" data-ratio=\"0.845\" data-width=\"400\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 400px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:84.5%\" href=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/8\/82063\/2760578-9927725383-TM_3D.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2760578\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/8\/82063\/2760578-9927725383-TM_3D.jpg\" srcset=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/8\/82063\/2760578-9927725383-TM_3D.jpg 400w, https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/8\/82063\/2760578-9927725383-TM_3D.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"><\/a><\/figure><p>Metroid Prime: Federation Force is a sci-fi first-person shooter developed by <a href=\"\/next-level-games-inc\/3010-1977\/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-1977\">Next Level<\/a> and published by <a href=\"\/nintendo\/3010-90\/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-90\">Nintendo<\/a> for the <a href=\"\/nintendo-3ds\/3045-117\/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-117\">Nintendo 3DS<\/a> on August 19, 2016.<\/p><p>Set in the <a href=\"\/metroid\/3025-3\/\" data-ref-id=\"3025-3\">Metroid<\/a> universe (and similar to <a href=\"\/metroid-prime-hunters\/3030-6215\/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-6215\">Metroid Prime: Hunters<\/a>), Federation Force is a <a href=\"\/spin-off\/3015-1100\/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-1100\">spin-off<\/a> (set after the events of the <a href=\"\/metroid-prime\/3025-1319\/\" data-ref-id=\"3025-1319\">Metroid Prime<\/a> trilogy) that does not star series protagonist <a href=\"\/samus-aran\/3005-99\/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-99\">Samus Aran<\/a> and is instead focused on the <a href=\"\/galactic-federation-marine\/3015-2325\/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-2325\">Marines<\/a> of the <a href=\"\/galactic-federation\/3015-1629\/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-1629\">Galactic Federation<\/a>.

The first two games in the series, originally released for the Nintendo GameCube, have been updated with 480p widescreen support, improved graphic effects, and motion controls similar to those found in Metroid Prime 3. The games have also been updated to include Metroid Prime 3's <a href=\"\/achievements\/3015-29\/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-29\">achievement<\/a> system, which allows players to earn colored tokens used to unlock bonus materials. All three games are available to play from the start.<\/p><p>The compilation was released as a Collector's Edition only. The North American version was packaged in a special metal case with a plastic sleeve while the European and Australian version came in a regular Wii game case with a cardboard slip cover. The game also came with a small pamphlet of concept art that contained a summary of the trilogy's story. Nintendo went with a compilation in Western territories instead of the separate releases of the original Metroid Prime and Metroid Prime 2 as <a href=\"..\/..\/new-play-control\/62-1197\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">New Play Control<\/a> editions previously released in Japan.<\/p><p>Nintendo of America discontinued Metroid Prime Trilogy on January 8th, 2010; less than half a year after the compilation was released. Nintendo of Australia followed suit on January 11th.<\/p><h2>Gameplay<\/h2><p>Metroid Prime Trilogy adopts the control system from Metroid Prime 3: Corruption and introduces it into the original two Metroid Prime GameCube games now on the Wii. Using this control method, the player points at the screen with the Wii Remote and moves <a href=\"\/samus-aran\/3005-99\/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-99\">Samus<\/a> with the Nunchuck.<\/p><p>The control layout differs between the revised controls for the first two games and those for Metroid Prime 3 in that the Minus Button switches between visors, rather than entering Hyper Mode.<\/p><p>Another key change is that the Spring Ball has been added to both Metroid Prime and Metroid Prime 2: Echoes and can be used by simply flicking the Wii Remote upward while Samus is in her <a href=\"\/morph-ball\/3055-1049\/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-1049\">Morph Ball<\/a> form. This ability is gained when the player gets the Morph Ball Bomb. This makes various sections easier, including the Spider Guardian boss battle in Metroid Prime 2: Echoes.<\/p><h2>Multiplayer<\/h2><p>The local four-player split-screen competitive multiplayer mode that appeared in Metroid Prime 2 is also included in its Wii incarnation. Because Metroid Prime Trilogy does not include the front-end menus of the stand-alone editions of the games, the mode is accessed from the main menu. <\/p><h2>Changes from the Originals<\/h2><p>In addition to adding 16:9 widescreen support and Wiimote and Nunchuck controls to the original Prime games, there are a few additional changes that should be noted for this compilation.<\/p><ul><li>There is a unified game menu, meaning the original menu themes are only accessible in the unlockables section.<\/li><li>Metroid Prime and Metroid Prime 2 have two selectable difficulties from the start instead of one.<\/li><li>Like Metroid Prime 3, performing specific actions in the GameCube Metroid Prime games will earn the player tokens which can be used to unlock items in the Unlockables section.<\/li><li>Sequence breaking in Metroid Prime has been changed to reflect the Players' Choice version of the game. Many breaks were removed while some are significantly harder to pull off like getting the Space Jump Boots first.<\/li><li>The <a href=\"\/fusion-suit\/3055-1020\/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-1020\">Fusion Suit<\/a>, originally a <a href=\"\/game-boy-advance\/3045-4\/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-4\">Game Boy Advance<\/a> <a href=\"\/super-game-boy-enhancement\/3015-4804\/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-4804\">link-up feature<\/a> unlocked when connecting Metroid Prime to the Game Boy Advance game <a href=\"\/metroid-fusion\/3030-10323\/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-10323\">Metroid Fusion<\/a> can now be unlocked in the Unlockables section. It cannot be used in Metroid Prime 2 or 3.<\/li><li>The special cannon effects (i.e. ice freezing over the cannon while charging the Ice Beam) and water splash effects in Metroid Prime have been removed. This was later explained as necessary because the original effects were only possible because of the static gun arm.

Samus is sent to the planet Aether by the Galactic Federation to look for a missing GF ship and scout team. Upon landing, Samus discovers that Aether is split into two \"halves\" due to a meteor collision: a \"light\" half, which is populated by the friendly, technologically advanced but nigh-extinct Luminoth people; and a \"dark\" half populated by the Ing - a purely destructive race of invaders. These two halves overlap each other, with the regions in the game having both a \"light\" version and a \"dark\" version, the latter usually being a lot more dangerous.<\/p><p>Critical reception was warm, but not as glowing as it was for its immediate predecessor and successor (<a href=\"\/metroid-prime-3-corruption\/3030-4725\/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-4725\">Metroid Prime 3: Corruption<\/a>). Common complaints included the amount of extra backtracking that the \"two dimensions\" concept introduced, as well as a lackluster multiplayer mode. It was praised for its visuals, sound and menu UI, however, and introducing a \"dark world\/light world\" mechanic greatly expanded the amount of explorable space, as well as making the game far more challenging for those who sought a tougher Metroid experience.<\/p><p>There was a mere two year gap between the release of Metroid Prime and Metroid Prime 2: Echoes, one fourth the time it took Nintendo to make the leap from<i> <\/i> <a href=\"\/super-metroid\/3030-8292\/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-8292\">Super Metroid<\/a> to the aforementioned. Although Nintendo spent only three years on Metroid Prime and weren't cooking the game for the full eight years they were neglecting the franchise, the difference in numbers led a small number of less observant Metroid fans to speculate as to whether Retro could repeat the same success in such a short time. Metroid Prime 2 was received well critically, but was lost amongst the Q4 '04 rush of <a href=\"\/half-life-2\/3030-1539\/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-1539\">Half-Life 2<\/a>, <a href=\"\/metal-gear-solid-3-snake-eater\/3030-18082\/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-18082\">Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater<\/a>, <a href=\"\/grand-theft-auto-san-andreas\/3030-7120\/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-7120\">Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas<\/a>, and <a href=\"\/halo-2\/3030-7110\/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-7110\">Halo 2<\/a>.<\/p><p>In the style of Halo 2's I Love Bees alternate reality game, Metroid Prime 2 also had an online viral marketing campaign. The campaign consisted of two websites: Orbis Labs and Channel 51. Orbis Labs was apparently a weapons development company that was, at the time, working on a piece of machinery known as the Battle Sphere, a nod to the Morph Ball featured in the Metroid series. Channel 51 was a blog in the style of a typical conspiracy theory website. Run by a \"<b>Sam<\/b>antha Man<b>us<\/b>,\" Channel 51 featured distorted Metroid Prime 2 footage as supposed video evidence of alien visitation to Earth, as well as other hints alluding to a few gameplay elements. When Metroid Prime 2 actually came out, \"Manus\" posted one last blog message bitterly complaining that she had been tricked and that \"it was all for a video game\", leading some less intelligent fans to wonder whether Channel 51 was a real conspiracy theory website that had been deliberately mislead by Nintendo to advertise their product.<\/p><h2>Story<\/h2><p>Metroid Prime 2, taking place six months after the events of Metroid Prime, (which itself took place in the years in between the original <a href=\"\/metroid\/3030-21761\/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-21761\"> Metroid<\/a> and the <a href=\"\/game-boy\/3045-3\/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-3\"> Game Boy<\/a> sequel <a href=\"\/metroid-ii-return-of-samus\/3030-5708\/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-5708\"> Metroid II: Return of Samus<\/a>) revolves around the conflict between two races, the <a href=\"\/luminoth\/3015-1552\/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-1552\"> Luminoth<\/a> and the <a href=\"\/ing\/3015-1459\/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-1459\"> Ing<\/a>, on the planet <a href=\"\/aether\/3035-378\/\" data-ref-id=\"3035-378\"> Aether<\/a>. Centuries prior to Samus' arrival, Aether was hit by a meteor of <a href=\"\/phazon\/3015-49\/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-49\"> Phazon<\/a>, duplicating the planet in a <a href=\"\/dark-aether\/3035-501\/\" data-ref-id=\"3035-501\"> Dark realm<\/a>, thus splitting the planet into two parallel universes. The Dark version of Aether became home to the Ing, a race of malevolent creatures of pure darkness, able to possess both organisms and machines. The Space Pirates, upon recently discovering Aether, had decided to harvest the Phazon in order to make up for their defeat on <a href=\"\/tallon-iv\/3035-168\/\" data-ref-id=\"3035-168\"> Tallon IV<\/a>. Samus Aran is sent to investigate, where she learns that the Luminoth, the original dwellers of the \"light\" Aether, had all but lost an ongoing battle between them and the Ing. It is Samus's mission to restore peace to Aether by defeating the Ing while simultaneously ridding the planet of Space Pirates and the mysterious <a href=\"\/dark-samus\/3005-3663\/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-3663\"> Dark Samus<\/a>, a hostile duplicate of Samus who clearly has some connection to the Phazon corrupting the planet.<\/p><h2>Gameplay<\/h2><p>Metroid Prime 2 carried most of its mechanics over from Metroid Prime, with a few minor improvements. For one, scanning was greatly improved, by removing the scan targets, instead allowing Samus to scan anywhere on an object\/enemy. In addition, objects and items are now color-coordinated. Important scans are now in red, and less important scans are now in blue. Objects Samus have already scanned are now in green. These refinements make scanning much easier in comparison, and was there once again in the <a href=\"\/wii\/3045-36\/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-36\"> Nintendo Wii<\/a> sequel Metroid Prime 3: Corruption.<\/p><p>Another additional is the controversial use of ammo for energy beams; although the standard Power Beam has unlimited energy, as always, the new Dark Beam and Light Beam have a limited supply of ammo. Killing enemies with the Dark Beam nets Samus light ammo, and vice-versa, in addition to being able to replenish her supplies with crates and ammo stations. Using the Light Beam on \"dark\" enemies or the Ing kills them faster than Samus's normal Power Beam, and the Dark Beam kills regular enemies faster. Finally, the \"Annihilator Beam\", which is extra-effective on all enemy types, uses both Dark and Light ammo to fire. Charging shots for all three weapons creates more powerful attacks, but drains more ammo than normal. Because some doors must be opened with different beams, just as in previous Metroid titles, even if a beam has zero ammo left, the player can \"charge up\" the empty weapon to fire a single regular-powered shot.<\/p><p>The final aspect of Metroid Prime 2 that differs from Metroid Prime is the Nintendo tradition of light and dark worlds. While normal Aether will not harm Samus in any way, the corrosive atmosphere of Dark Aether will constantly drain her health until she dies, although pools of light scattered about by the Luminoth during their failed invasions of Dark Aether will protect and even heal Samus; indeed, because these pools of light will actually heal her health fully instead of just replenishing damage suffered by the corrosive atmosphere, Dark Aether is actually safer for Samus since she can always retreat to the safety of a light pool and wait to become 100% healed. Eventually, Samus locates the Dark Suit upgrade, which greatly increases her resistance to Dark Aether's atmosphere, slowing down the rate at which it burns away her health, and later on the Light Suit, which renders her completely impervious to the dark atmosphere, though pools of light will still heal her.<\/p><h2>Weapons<\/h2><p>In Metroid Prime 2: Echoes, Samus earns a wide variety of weapons and power-ups throughout the game to aid her on her adventure. Although she starts out with some of them, they are <a href=\"\/abilitease\/3015-57\/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-57\">taken away early on<\/a>.<\/p><h3>Power Beam<\/h3><p>The default weapon, which allows Samus to fire the fastest. She can also Hold the fire button to charge it, otherwise known as the Charge Beam.<\/p><h3><b>Light Beam<\/b><\/h3><p>The light beam can go through multiple enemies, and it has the possibility to set enemies on fire. This uses light energy ammo. Charging it allows Samus to fire a Lightblast attack, which costs 5 Light ammo to use.<\/p><h3>Dark Beam<\/h3><p>The dark beam fires shadow energy, which has the possibility to slow down enemies and objects. This uses dark energy ammo. Charging it allows Samus to fire an Entangler attack, which costs 5 Dark ammo to use.<\/p><h3><b>Annihilator Beam<\/b><\/h3><p>This beam combines the power of the Light and Dark beams, and uses both light and dark energy to use. Charging it allows Samus to fire a Disruptor attack, which costs 5 of each type of energy ammo to use.<\/p><h3>Sunburst<\/h3><p>The Sunburst is the Charge Combo for the Light Beam, a slow moving, widespread attack which will set enemies on fire. Using it requires 5 missiles as well as 30 Light ammo.<\/p><h3>Darkburst<\/h3><p>The Darkburst is the Charge Combo for the Dark Beam, which opens up a portal to a dark dimension, pulling enemies into it. Using it requires 5 missiles as well as 30 Dark ammo.<\/p><h3>Sonic Boom<\/h3><p>The Sonic Boom is the Annihilator Charge Combo. Using it costs 5 missiles, 30 light ammo and 30 dark ammo.<\/p><h3>Missile Launcher<\/h3><p>This allows Samus to fire Missiles, and she can either fire them with or without a lock-on. They can also destroy objects made of Brinstone.<\/p><h3>Seeker Missile Launcher<\/h3><p>This weapon upgrade allows Samus to fire missiles at multiple targets at the same time by allowing her to charge her missiles. However, the Seeker Missiles cannot be engaged without wasting a single missile first in order to start the system. Samus can also lock onto the same enemy multiple times.<\/p><h3>Super Missile<\/h3><p>By charging the Power Beam then using a Missile allows Samus to fire a Super Missile. Using the Super Missile costs 5 missiles.<\/p><h3>Morph Ball Bomb<\/h3><p>This is the default weapon while in the Morph Ball form. It can also be used to break cracked walls as well as perform a power ball jump. It can also break items made of Talloric alloy.<\/p><h3>Power Bomb<\/h3><p>This is the strongest Morph Ball weapon. It can destroy a lot of materials, including Denzium, and each expansion Samus finds for it will increase its capacity by one.<\/p><h2>Suit Expansions<\/h2><p>Suit Expansions are nothing new to the Metroid franchise, but in this game they brought some more familiar expansions into the 3D realm as well as some new ones.<\/p><h3>Morph Ball<\/h3><p>The Morph Ball allows Samus to travel through tight corridors and travel faster overall, and is upgradeable.<\/p><h3>Boost Ball<\/h3><p>This upgrade allows Samus to quickly speed through areas, and she can also charge it up. By charging up the boost ball in some devices, it can solve some puzzles as well as get past some obstacles. Samus can also damage some enemies by boosting into them.<\/p><h3>Spider Ball<\/h3><p>This allows Samus to move across magnetic rails. By combining this with the Boost Ball she can propel to other Magnetic rails, a feature not present in the original Metroid Prime.<\/p><h3>Space Jump Boots<\/h3><p>These allow Samus to jump higher as well as perform a <a href=\"\/double-jump\/3015-1\/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-1\"> double jump<\/a>.<\/p><h3>Gravity Boost<\/h3><p>This allows Samus to move through water without limitations, so in essence, it's the <a href=\"\/gravity-suit\/3055-1033\/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-1033\"> Gravity Suit<\/a>, but not in suit form. By combining it with the Space Jump Boots in water, by holding B she can slowly rise and move through water.<\/p><h3>Grapple Beam<\/h3><p>This allows Samus to swing back and forth using grapple points found in the game. She can also change her direction while swinging.<\/p><h3>Screw Attack<\/h3><p>This allows Samus to turn into a moving weapon while jumping. She has a limited amount of jumps, but she can also slightly steer where she is going as well. Samus can also perform a wall jump while facing a special wall surface and bouncing off it in midair.<\/p><h3>Varia Suit<\/h3><p>This is the default suit, and while on <a href=\"\/dark-aether\/3035-501\/\" data-ref-id=\"3035-501\"> Dark Aether<\/a>, Samus's energy is drained rapidly by its atmosphere.<\/p><h3>Dark Suit<\/h3><p>This suit decreases the amount of energy Samus loses while on Dark Aether through its atmosphere.<\/p><h3>Light Suit<\/h3><p>This suit negates all damage Samus takes from Dark Aether's atmosphere and she won't be impeded by its toxic water.

On August 22, the name was changed to Metroid Prime Pinball, and Nintendo released initial details, including the Rumble Pak. Metroid Prime Pinball is the first game to be compatible with said Rumble Pak, an accessory for the Nintendo DS which adds rumble functionality. The Rumble Pak sends out a vibration when certain actions occur in game, and was later sold as a standalone accessory.<br \/><br \/> Metroid Prime Pinball received positive reviews, with many critics praising how well the <a data-ref-id=\"3025-3\" href=\"\/metroid\/3025-3\/\">Metroid<\/a> universe fits in a pinball game. Metroid Prime Pinball has an 80.39% average on Game Rankings and a 79% average on Metacritic. Although there was skepticism about the concept initially, critics found the game to be well designed, with unique and interesting stages and a great integration of Samus Aran's abilities. Criticisms for the game included a lack of variety and the fact that the game seemed to be aimed more towards Metroid fans than pinball fans.<br \/> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0<br \/><h2>Gameplay<\/h2><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/7465\/1326781-18641_thumbzoom.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1326781\" data-size=\"small\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-ratio=\"1.5\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:150.0%\" href=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/7465\/1326781-18641_thumbzoom.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1326781\"><img alt=\"\u00a0The game's first table, Pirate Frigate.\" src=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/0\/7465\/1326781-18641_thumbzoom.jpg\" srcset=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/7465\/1326781-18641_thumbzoom.jpg 500w, https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/0\/7465\/1326781-18641_thumbzoom.jpg 426w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 426px) 100vw, 426px\" data-width=\"426\"><\/a><figcaption>\u00a0The game's first table, Pirate Frigate.<\/figcaption><\/figure>     A traditional pinball game, Metroid Prime Pinball retains many of the aspects of a typical pinball cabinet, including bumpers, flippers, ramps, spinners, etc. Additionally, Metroid Prime Pinball adds a variety of elements taken from the Metroid Prime games, including enemies, Samus's abilities, and weaponry. The game has six different stages, all of which are based off of an area in Metroid Prime.\u00a0<br \/><br \/> Metroid Prime Pinball takes advantage of the many unique aspects of the Nintendo DS. Although initially Fuse Games struggled with the dual screens (particularly the small gap between the screens), they solved the issue by placing a second set of flippers on the top screen, to compensate for the blind area.

These are collected by completing goals, such as playing minigames or fighting a boss. After managing to complete all twelve Artifacts, the player can continue to do these objectives, but will only earn 50,000 points, instead of additional Artifacts. The collection of all twelve Artifacts unlocks the table Artifact Temple, where the player must defeat Meta Ridely by hitting twelve different targets on the table. After finishing Artifact Temple, the final table is unlocked; Impact Crater. Impact Crater is where Metroid Prime lives, and the player must defeat it in order to complete the game. Completion of the game unlocks a harder difficulty, titled Expert Mode.<br \/><br \/> In multiplayer, players can compete using single cartridge play or multi-cartridge play (with up to eight players competing). The goal of multiplayer is to reach a certain preset score first. Multiplayer mode is especially notable for the inclusion of a table not found in the single player mode, titled Magmoor Caverns.\u00a0<br \/>\u00a0<br \/><h2>Tables<\/h2><ul class=\"plain-list\"><li><b>Pirate Frigate<\/b> - One of the first two tables available, based on the first area in Metroid Prime<\/li><li><b>Tallon Overworld<\/b> - One of the first two tables available, based on the second area in Metroid Prime<\/li><li><b>Phendrana Drifts<\/b> - In the second group of tables unlocked; the boss is Thardus<\/li><li><b>Phazon Mines<\/b> - In the second group of tables unlocked; the boss is Omega Pirate<\/li><li><b>Artifact Temple<\/b> - Unlocked after finding all twelve Artifacts; the boss is Meta Ridley<\/li><li><b>Impact Crater<\/b> - Unlocked after finishing the Artifact Temple table; the boss is Metroid Prime<\/li><li><b>Magmoor Caverns<\/b> - Only available in multiplayer<\/li><\/ul><br \/><h2>Minigames<\/h2><ul class=\"plain-list\"><li><b>Beetle Blas<\/b>t - Found on Tallon Overworld, this minigame is activated after collecting the letters to spell \"SAMUS\" on that table.

Hunters takes place in between Metroid Prime and Metroid Prime 2: Echoes in the otherwise unmentioned Alimbic Cluster.","description":"<h2>Overview<\/h2><p>Metroid Prime: Hunters is a DS spin-off of the <a href=\"\/metroid-prime-hunters\/3030-6215\/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-6215\">Metroid Prime<\/a> series for the GameCube and Wii. Like its console equivalents, it uses a first-person perspective and partly emphasizes exploration and acquiring new gadgets to progress and fight bosses. Hunters scales back these elements to focus on the first-person shooting action. <\/p><p>The story concerns intergalactic bounty hunter Samus Aran after she is hired by the Galactic Federation to either acquire or destroy a rumored \"ultimate power\" before it can fall into the wrong hands. Unfortunately, six other less scrupulous bounty hunters intercept the signal and chase after this power, either for themselves or to sell it to the highest bidder. As well as the hostile native wildlife, Samus has to contend with these spacefaring contemporaries in order to complete her mission. The game takes place between the events of <a href=\"\/metroid-prime\/3030-15473\/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-15473\">Metroid Prime<\/a> and <a href=\"\/metroid-prime-2-echoes\/3030-1597\/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-1597\">Metroid Prime 2: Echoes<\/a>.<\/p><h2>Gameplay<\/h2><p>Metroid Prime: Hunters plays much like its cousin Metroid Prime games, only on the <a href=\"\/nintendo-ds\/3045-52\/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-52\">Nintendo DS<\/a>. <a href=\"\/samus-aran\/3005-99\/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-99\">Samus Aran<\/a> travels from planet to planet in search of a vaguely-defined Ultimate Power. In order to obtain this Power, Samus must collect all eight Octoliths scattered throughout the Alimbic Cluster. After obtaining the Octoliths, however, she must be wary of rival <a href=\"\/bounty-hunter\/3015-6234\/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-6234\">bounty hunters<\/a> seeking out the Power. If Samus loses a fight with a hunter, she loses her Octoliths to that hunter. But the Octoliths are not lost forever at this point, if she encounters the particular hunter she lost to again and defeats him, she recollects her Octoliths. Scouting for hunters is made easier by the sidebar that appears on the planet select screen. This sidebar indicates which hunters are on the currently highlighted planet making it easier to find the hunter that stole her Octoliths, or avoiding other hunters entirely.<\/p><p>Along with several of her old weapons (ex. <a href=\"\/morph-ball\/3055-1049\/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-1049\">Morph Ball<\/a>, <a href=\"\/missile-launcher\/3055-3889\/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-3889\">Missile Launcher<\/a>), Samus can find and acquire several new weapons exclusive to the game. Each weapon is originally wielded by one of the other hunters, but Samus can find and use these weapons herself. Each weapon has its own unique ability and use, along with working especially well in the hands of its original designer. These new weapons are the:<\/p><ul><li>Battlehammer (<a href=\"\/weavel\/3005-3066\/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-3066\">Weavel<\/a>'s concussive mortar)<\/li><li>Imperialist (<a href=\"\/trace\/3005-3063\/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-3063\">Trace<\/a>'s sniper Weapon)<\/li><li>Judicator (<a href=\"\/noxus\/3005-3061\/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-3061\">Noxus<\/a>' ice spears)<\/li><li>Magmaul (<a href=\"\/spire\/3005-3067\/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-3067\">Spire<\/a>'s flame cannon)<\/li><li>Shock Coil (<a href=\"\/sylux\/3005-3064\/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-3064\">Sylux<\/a>'s sustained electric stream)<\/li><li>Volt Driver (<a href=\"\/kanden\/3005-3065\/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-3065\">Kanden<\/a>'s electric bullets)<\/li><\/ul><p>Samus's own \"signature weapon\" is the Missile Launcher.<\/p><h2>Control<\/h2><p>Metroid Prime: Hunters gives the player the choice between two different control options. The \"Dual Mode\" option uses D-Pad in conjunction with the A\/B\/X\/Y buttons to try to emulate the dual-stick configuration of most console shooters: move with one stick, aim with the other; only in this case, the \"sticks\" are buttons. The configuration works fairly well, despite not being actual joysticks. The main shortcomings for this control setting are the lack of precision coupled with the difficulty to access the ever-necessary touch screen. The \"Stylus Mode\" option uses the D-Pad and Touch Screen in a sort of \"point and click\" control style. The user moves around with the D-pad (or A\/B\/X\/Y for lefties) and uses the Touch Screen to aim; dragging the stylus up to aim up, down to aim down, etc. This control type allows for more precise aiming and has the stylus next to the Touch Screen the whole time.<\/p><p>The game also accounts for right- and left-handedness and offers both of these options for each control type. Choosing the right-hand option has the user moving with the D-Pad on the left of the DS and aiming with their right hand on the Touch Screen. The left-hand option has the user moving with the A\/B\/X\/Y buttons and aiming with their left hand.<\/p><p>Regardless of control type, several of the games main items are located on the touch screen and the user always fires with the L button (or R for lefties). Transforming into the Morph Ball, for example, requires a tap of the Morph Ball icon on the touch screen. Switching between weapons requires opening a menu on the touch screen and picking the desired weapon. Even jumping requires a quick double-tap of the screen (though the other shoulder button can also be used in \"Dual Mode\").<\/p><h2>Multiplayer<\/h2><p>Metroid Prime: Hunters returns a dynamic multiplayer experience to the Prime series after its introduction in Metroid Prime 2: Echoes. Each player chooses from a list of the seven hunters that appear in the game and battle each other in various maps with various objectives. This multiplayer system also works with the Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection and lets players designate other players as \u201cRivals\u201d or \u201cFriends.\u201d<\/p><h3>Power-Ups<\/h3><ul><li>Heatlh Increase: The most basic of power-ups, the health balls increase the player's current hit points by 20 or 50. Theses hit points stay on the character until they are damaged enough to remove them. The maximum health a player can have is 199.<\/li><li>Missile Ammo: At the beginning of every life, the player starts off with 10 missiles. If the player picks up missile ammo, their current missile count increases by 5 to a maximum of 59.<\/li><li>Universal Ammo: Universal ammo (UA) is used to power the special beams. Since each beam uses a different amount of ammo, the max ammo varies by beam.<\/li><li>Cloak: Quite simply, the Cloak makes the player character invisible. Although other players will probably be able to locate an invisible Hunter by the slight distortion they create, this power-up makes ambushes MUCH easier.<\/li><li>Double Damage: Even more simply, every attack the player does for about a minute is doubled. This includes Alt-form attacks, beam attacks, even splash damage.<\/li><li>Deathalt: The Deathalt power-up forces the player to enter their Alt-Form for about 90 seconds. If any opponent touches the player in this state, they are instantly killed; the player does not even need to attack the opponent, merely a touch will cause death. This power-up is especially deadly with Sylux (as he has the fastest moving Alt-Form of all the Hunters) and Spire (as his wall-climbing ability makes for good surprise attacks).<\/li><li>Affinity Weapon: Although any character can pick up any weapon, the Affinity Weapon power-up gives the player his Hunter-specific weapon. This is useful for characters whose Affinity Weapon usually does not appear on a particular map. With this power-up, they will be the only Hunter with that particular weapon. This power-up gives Samus 5 more missiles<\/li><\/ul><h3>Weapons<\/h3><p>Although Hunters does not feature a huge array of weapons, each weapon is very different from the next. <\/p><ul><li>Power Beam: Being the default weapon, the Power Beam is the weakest of all beams but has the fastest rate of fire. The Power Beam can be charged by holding the fire button for about a second and does about twelve times as much damage. Every character starts off with the Power Beam.<\/li><li>Missiles: High-damaging explosive blasts with splash damage. Missiles are a bit hard to use due to their high travel time, but they deal huge damage if they score a direct hit. When charged, missiles do 36 damage and use up two ammo. Samus\u2019s missiles can home on opponents when charged.<\/li><li>Battlehammer: A short-ranged, high-damaging concussion beam with splash damage. The Battlehammer doesn\u2019t really fill any weapon niches. Its short-range makes it difficult to hit opponents and it often damages the user. The Battlehammer has a rapid fire function instead of a charge function.<\/li><li>Imperialist: Sniper beam. Slow-firing, but does huge damage when a direct hit is scored (36 body, 100 head). Zoom function refines aim and doubles damage (so a zoomed headshot does 200 damage; equal to max HP). Zoom function magnifies view even more when on an opponent, making it easier to spot hidden hunters (even cloaked).<\/li><li>Judicator: Ricocheting ice beam. The Judicator fires fairly slowly, but does large damage with each shot, even when bounced. The charge function fires three shots at the same time, dealing as much as 96 damage with a triple headshot. Noxus\u2019 charge is a short-ranged blast that freezes the enemy.<\/li><li>Magmaul: Short-ranged, area damage. The Magmaul is the single most effective weapon for dealing with Alt-Forms. By simply aiming at the floor, the player can both make it nearly impossible for their attacker to continue AND difficult to retreat. Caution: Magmaul does damage to user if in close proximity.<\/li><li>Shock Coil- Auto-locking electric beam. The Shock Coil fires a continuous stream of damage at an opponent once it is locked on. As the user continues locked onto an opponent, the stream gains power and can be devastating. Starts off doing about 5 damage per second and does up to 30 damage per second.<\/li><li>Volt Driver- Souped-up Power Beam. The Volt driver shoots almost as fast as the Power Beam and does more damage. This weapon should be used as a replacement for the Power Beam until more weapons are found, just be careful not to run out of ammo. Charge shot has a small blast radius.<\/li><li>Omega Cannon- A one-hit-kill weapon with an enormous blast radius. Only available on the \"Oubliette\" stage, the Omega Cannon shoots a slow moving ball of light and detonates as soon as it strikes a surface or enemy. Be weary, the blast will kill all hunters in range, including the one who fired it.<\/li><\/ul><h2>Hunters<\/h2><p>Each of the Hunters has its own \u201cAffinity Weapon\u201d (ex. Shock Coil, Judicator), \u201calt-form\u201d (i.e. Morph Ball, Dialanche), and other benefits.<\/p><p><b>Samus Aran<\/b><\/p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-img-src=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/118\/251738-ds_metroid_prime_hunters.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-251738\" data-size=\"small\" style=\"width: 1024px\" data-ratio=\"0.75\" data-width=\"1024\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:75.0%\" href=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/118\/251738-ds_metroid_prime_hunters.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-251738\"><img alt=\"Samus Aran\" src=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/0\/118\/251738-ds_metroid_prime_hunters.jpg\" srcset=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/118\/251738-ds_metroid_prime_hunters.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_super\/0\/118\/251738-ds_metroid_prime_hunters.jpg 960w, https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_medium\/0\/118\/251738-ds_metroid_prime_hunters.jpg 480w, https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/0\/118\/251738-ds_metroid_prime_hunters.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"><\/a><figcaption>Samus Aran<\/figcaption><\/figure><p><a href=\"\/samus-aran\/3005-99\/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-99\">Samus<\/a> is the all around hunter. Average size, Alt-Form, head size, etc. This makes it easier for her to adapt in many situations, but also makes it difficult for her to specialize in anything. Her main asset is that she starts the match with her Affinity Weapon: the missiles. Her main weakness is that the missiles aren't very powerful.<\/p><p>Affinity Weapon: Missiles. If the player charges Samus\u2019s missiles, they gain a limited seeking capability, making them much more difficult to avoid than the other hunters\u2019. Missiles have a high travel time and usually go in a straight line, making them easy to avoid and hard to use for most Hunters. However, since Samus\u2019s missiles can home in on opponents, she can use this high damaging weapon to better effect and not have to worry about her opponents\u2019 missiles as much.<\/p><p>Alt-Form: Morph Ball. Samus\u2019s Morph Ball is one of the easiest alt-forms to use, while still remaining useful. The Morph Ball is quick and can be moved in any direction at any time, allowing for hairpin turns and quick escapes. Her Boost Ball function adds to the Morph Ball\u2019s speed by giving the player short bursts of speed that can be used to retreat quicker or to tackle opponents. The Morph Ball\u2019s bombs can also amass large amounts of damage quickly if they hit the opponent each time. Though only three morph balls can be laid out at a time and they usually take a while to explode, if an opponent runs into one, they explode instantly and allow for another quick deployment. Getting right up next to an opponent and dropping several bombs at a time is an effective strategy with this ability.<\/p><p><b>Kanden<\/b><\/p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/8960\/1803871-kanden.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1803871\" data-size=\"small\" style=\"width: 300px\" data-ratio=\"1.5366666666667\" data-width=\"300\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:153.7%\" href=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/8960\/1803871-kanden.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1803871\"><img alt=\"Kanden\" src=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/8960\/1803871-kanden.jpg\" srcset=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/8960\/1803871-kanden.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" data-width=\"300\"><\/a><figcaption>Kanden<\/figcaption><\/figure><p><a href=\"\/kanden\/3005-3065\/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-3065\">Kanden<\/a> has a slightly bigger character model than most characters, making him an easier target. His small head compensates for this fact, however, by allowing him to avoid high-damaging headshots. His Alt-Form gives him one of the best hit-and-run games of all the hunters.<\/p><p>Affinity Weapon: Volt Driver. Kanden's Volt Driver causes the visor of the opponent to blur a little and when charged, the Volt Driver gains homing capabilities. This ability can be extremely useful if the opponent is stuck in a corner, as they will have much trouble evading the shot (or at least its blast radius) and the player can follow several uncharged shots while the opponent is disoriented.<\/p><p>Alt-Form: Stinglarva. Kanden's Stinglarva may be offensively terrible, but it can easily be used to escape a dangerous situation. Although it does not move very quickly, the Stinglarva's \"tail mines\" make it difficult to chase down without taking a substantial amount of damage. Kanden can drop two or three of these mines at a time behind him and they remain still for a time. If an opponent happens to come to close to the mines, they will instantly home in on the opponent with surprising speed and accuracy. Despite the Stinglarva's inability to attack head-on, it is one of the best retreating tools in the game.<\/p><p><b>Spire<\/b><\/p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-img-src=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/8960\/1803872-spire.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1803872\" data-size=\"small\" style=\"width: 300px\" data-ratio=\"1.44\" data-width=\"300\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:144.0%\" href=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/8960\/1803872-spire.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1803872\"><img alt=\"Spire\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" data-width=\"300\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/8960\/1803872-spire.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/8960\/1803872-spire.jpg 300w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Spire\" src=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/8960\/1803872-spire.jpg\" srcset=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/8960\/1803872-spire.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" data-width=\"300\"><\/noscript><\/a><figcaption>Spire<\/figcaption><\/figure><p><a href=\"\/spire\/3005-3067\/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-3067\">Spire<\/a>, like Kanden, has a slightly bulkier frame than the other hunters, but a smaller head. His Magmaul's special ability is devastating on Alt-Forms, hitting them with both the original force of the weapon plus the burning damage. He also takes no damage from environmental lava as in the \"Alinos Gateway\" stage.<\/p><p>Affinity Weapon: Magmaul. Spire's Magmaul causes the opponent to catch on fire when charged, dealing damage over time. As the Magmaul is the best weapon for dealing with Alt-Forms, Spire can make short work of opponents in Alt-Form by charging shots in front of them over and over leading to massive amounts of damage whether they decide to continue the attack or retreat.<\/p><p>Alt-Form: Dialanche. Spire's Dialanche is a large, slow moving chunk of rock with only a physical attack. Its large size couples well with its physical attack because it gives him a wider attacking radius. A slow, physical Alt-Form seems lackluster, but it also has the unique capability of climbing walls. This allows the player to sneak attack opponents sitting on ledges and possibly pick up the kill before they even know what hit them. It works even better on snipers hiding on ledges while zoomed in. The Dialanche moves across walls at about the same speed as it moves along the floor.<\/p><p><b>Noxus<\/b><\/p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/5962\/656655-noxus.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-656655\" data-size=\"small\" style=\"width: 1000px\" data-ratio=\"1.429\" data-width=\"1000\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:142.9%\" href=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/5962\/656655-noxus.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-656655\"><img alt=\"Noxus\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/0\/5962\/656655-noxus.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/5962\/656655-noxus.jpg 1000w, https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_medium\/0\/5962\/656655-noxus.jpg 671w, https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/0\/5962\/656655-noxus.jpg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Noxus\" src=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/0\/5962\/656655-noxus.jpg\" srcset=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/5962\/656655-noxus.jpg 1000w, https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_medium\/0\/5962\/656655-noxus.jpg 671w, https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/0\/5962\/656655-noxus.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"><\/noscript><\/a><figcaption>Noxus<\/figcaption><\/figure><p><a href=\"\/noxus\/3005-3061\/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-3061\">Noxus<\/a> has the same body size and head size as Samus, also known as average.<\/p><p>Affinity Weapon: Judicator. When Noxus charges his Judicator, it sends out a wide short-range wall of ice instead of the usual triple shot. This wall of ice freezes the opponent for a few seconds, leaving him unable to move. This ability can be very useful when coupled with another strong weapon, such as Missiles; freeze the opponent and unload several high-damaging missiles that are usually hard to hit with.<\/p><p>Alt-Form: Vhoscythe. Vhoscythe. Noxus\u2019 Vhoscythe is probably the least glamorous of any of the hunters. It\u2019s basically just a spinning crouched version of his biped form with an extendable blade for an attack. It doesn\u2019t move very fast and the blade doesn\u2019t do a ton of damage. It can rack up a bit of damage by remaining near an opponent and slashing them multiple times if spaced correctly, but if the Vhoscythe touches an opponent it bounces away from him. Basically a faster, weaker version of the Dialanche that can\u2019t climb walls.<\/p><p><b>Sylux<\/b><\/p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-img-src=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/8960\/1803878-sylux.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1803878\" data-size=\"small\" style=\"width: 300px\" data-ratio=\"1.4266666666667\" data-width=\"300\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:142.7%\" href=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/8960\/1803878-sylux.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1803878\"><img alt=\"Sylux\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" data-width=\"300\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/8960\/1803878-sylux.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/8960\/1803878-sylux.jpg 300w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Sylux\" src=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/8960\/1803878-sylux.jpg\" srcset=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/8960\/1803878-sylux.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" data-width=\"300\"><\/noscript><\/a><figcaption>Sylux<\/figcaption><\/figure><p><a href=\"\/sylux\/3005-3064\/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-3064\">Sylux<\/a> has a slightly smaller frame than the other hunters, but has a larger head, making him a little easier to headshot. His high-speed, high-damaging Alt-Form coupled with the increased durability granted by his Affinity Weapon make Sylux the second most popular hunter in multi-player.<\/p><p>Affinity Weapon: Shock Coil. When Sylux fires his Shock Coil, all of the damage done to the victim is transferred to the Sylux. This makes the Shock Coil a good weapon for stand-offs as Sylux will be dealing damage while healing his own damage at the same time. The rate of health absorption increases in a linear fashion with respects to the damage the Shock Coil is currently doing.<\/p><p>Alt-Form: Lockjaw. Sylux's Lockjaw is by far the fastest moving Alt-Form of all the hunters. The Lockjaw can drop one, two, or three electric \u201ccharges\u201d that perform differently dependent on number. One charge is a simple bomb, two charges creates a tripwire effect that attacks opponents that pass through, and three charges creates an explosive triangle that can do up to 180 damage. All of these factors combined make the Lockjaw great for setting up traps and leading opponents into them; unfortunately it also leads people to spam this alt-form the most.<\/p><p><b>Weavel<\/b><\/p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/8960\/1803880-weavel.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1803880\" data-size=\"small\" style=\"width: 300px\" data-ratio=\"1.4266666666667\" data-width=\"300\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:142.7%\" href=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/8960\/1803880-weavel.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1803880\"><img alt=\"Weavel\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" data-width=\"300\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/8960\/1803880-weavel.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/8960\/1803880-weavel.jpg 300w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Weavel\" src=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/8960\/1803880-weavel.jpg\" srcset=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/8960\/1803880-weavel.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" data-width=\"300\"><\/noscript><\/a><figcaption>Weavel<\/figcaption><\/figure><p><a href=\"\/weavel\/3005-3066\/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-3066\">Weavel<\/a> shares the average body and head size of Samus and Noxus. His difficult to master Alt-Form and Battlehammer make Weavel something of a niche character to play, but when mastered he becomes the most difficult character to approach and a deadly force on any stage.<\/p><p>Affinity Weapon: Battlehammer. Weavel's Battlehammer uses up twice as much ammo but deals much more damage with the splash radius on the weapon. This ability makes opponents fearful to approach Weavel as they will be just as afraid of the blast radius as they will of the actual shot. This spacing improvement also allows for great control of the stage; whether on a small scale or a large scale.<\/p><p>Alt-Form: Halfturret. Weavel's Halfturret splits into two parts upon activation: the top, mobile half with a blade attack and the bottom, stationary half with a turret. The turret fires non-Affinity Battlehammer shots when opponents come within range, making it double as an alarm when someone approaches an area. The downside to this amazing dual-nature Alt-Form is that the two halves share damage. If the turret is destroyed, Weavel reverts to biped form; but if the top half is destroyed, the player is killed.<\/p><p><b>Trace<\/b><\/p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-img-src=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/1\/19629\/704165-hunter_trace.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-704165\" data-size=\"small\" style=\"width: 355px\" data-ratio=\"1.4281690140845\" data-width=\"355\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:142.8%\" href=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/1\/19629\/704165-hunter_trace.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-704165\"><img alt=\"Trace\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/1\/19629\/704165-hunter_trace.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/1\/19629\/704165-hunter_trace.jpg 355w, https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/1\/19629\/704165-hunter_trace.jpg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Trace\" src=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/1\/19629\/704165-hunter_trace.jpg\" srcset=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/1\/19629\/704165-hunter_trace.jpg 355w, https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/1\/19629\/704165-hunter_trace.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"><\/noscript><\/a><figcaption>Trace<\/figcaption><\/figure><p><a href=\"\/trace\/3005-3063\/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-3063\">Trace<\/a> has the most skeletal figure of all the characters but, in turn, has the largest head. This is something of an ironic trait when compared to the headshot-heavy nature of his Affinity Weapon, the Imperialist. A powerful Alt-Form coupled with the gaming community's addiction to sniper weapons makes Trace, by far, the most commonly played hunter online.<\/p><p>Affinity Weapon: Imperialist. If Trace stands still for a few seconds with the Imperialist equipped, he becomes almost completely invisible, making for and impromptu cloaking ability. This ability works well in conjunction with the long-ranged nature of the weapon, allowing Trace to snipe enemies across the stage while maintaining a decent concealment from opponents at close range.<\/p><p>Alt-Form: Triskelion. Trace\u2019s Triskelion is a fast-moving oversized spider. Despite being armed with only a melee attack, it is one of the fastest ways of picking up kills doing a whopping 50 damage with each lunge; two hits is enough to kill a re-spawned player. \u201cLunge\u201d is no exaggeration as Trace shoots forward a great deal with the attack. The Triskelion\u2019s secondary function is a stealth function that works the same as Trace wielding the Imperialist. If the player does not move for a few seconds, the Triskelion becomes nearly invisible, making sneak attacks extremely easy.<\/p><h2>First Hunt<\/h2><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/10\/103881\/2344082-first_hunt_cart.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2344082\" data-size=\"small\" style=\"width: 389px\" data-ratio=\"1.0616966580977\" data-width=\"389\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:106.2%\" href=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/10\/103881\/2344082-first_hunt_cart.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2344082\"><img alt=\"The First Hunt Cart\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/10\/103881\/2344082-first_hunt_cart.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/10\/103881\/2344082-first_hunt_cart.jpg 389w, https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/10\/103881\/2344082-first_hunt_cart.jpg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"The First Hunt Cart\" src=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/10\/103881\/2344082-first_hunt_cart.jpg\" srcset=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/10\/103881\/2344082-first_hunt_cart.jpg 389w, https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/10\/103881\/2344082-first_hunt_cart.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"><\/noscript><\/a><figcaption>The First Hunt Cart<\/figcaption><\/figure><p>Originally, a demo titled Metroid Prime Hunters: First Hunt was packaged along with every DS at launch. The demo gave players a taste of what the Nintendo DS was capable of, as well as tease people for when Metroid Prime: Hunters was released, although its controls were notably very different from those of the final product. The demo offered three sort of mini-game scenarios for the player. Interestingly, while First Hunt features appearances by <a href=\"\/metroid\/3015-1081\/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-1081\">Metroids<\/a>, none of the creatures actually appear in the finished retail version of Hunters.<\/p><p>First was a brief level where the player goes from room to room, eliminating enemies before the door to the next room could be opened.
